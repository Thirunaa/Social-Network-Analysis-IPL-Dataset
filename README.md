# Social-Network-Analysis-IPL-Dataset
This repository has the details of the nodes and edges and related IPL data used for the building the Social Network Analysis.
1.	Begin with your dataset. If you did not submit a dataset for last week's assignment, you must include the link to a dataset. If you have changed your mind on a dataset, include it here 
I have found another dataset, with updated data (till 2017), but my thesis statement and nodes/edges will remain same. So, I will be using the updated dataset for my analysis (attached the new link and old link below).

2.	Create your thesis statement (problem to solve with your dataset)
Thesis Statement: This dataset has ball-by-ball detail of 637 matches of IPL (Indian Premier League). The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a men's T20 franchise cricket league of India. This data can address the following questions
-	Which team was the most successful team of all time? Why?
-	Who was the Most valuable player (batsman, bowler, all-rounder) in each team? Why?
-	Who were the two most successful teams and what is the Win/Loss statistics between them.
-	What are the statistics between top 10 batsmen and 10 bowlers, throughout the 637 matches?

Why this dataset?
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$5.9 billion). According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy. The 2020 IPL season set a massive viewership record with 31.57 million average impressions and with an overall consumption increase of 23 per cent from the 2019 season.
So, the nodes and edges from this data between the players and franchise can tell us lot of stories and answers. This analysis can also be used by franchise to buy and sell players during auction, which gives detailed data points on how much a player could contribute to a team’s victory which, in turn, is a crucial data in a humongous sports league like IPL.

3.	Determine which nodes/edges from your dataset will help answer the problem to solve in #2 above.
To determine the performance of all the teams and top players. The following can be considered as potential nodes.
•	Name of the Batsman
•	Name of the Bowler
•	Overs (Players who perform well at the end of the match are major part in teams’ victory)
•	Name of the Team
4.	Identify the type of supporting data you will share about your dataset. What is the size of your dataset, will you filter values, what types or charts/graphs will you use that are NOT social network graphs.
For this analysis, 6 datasets will be used. Those are,
Ball-by-ball data - 150,451 rows, 48 columns
Match data - 637 rows, 17 columns
Player data - 497 rows, 7 columns
Player-match data - 13,993 rows, 22 columns
Team data - 13 rows, 3 columns
 Filters will be the crucial part of the analysis, filters will be applied on the batsman, bowlers, teams, and overs data to get general idea about the data and to clean the data set, if needed. 
Graphs and charts like Bar graph, Dual axis chart, Line graph, Pie chart and Heap map will be used to visually communicate the stories and connections between the data points.
